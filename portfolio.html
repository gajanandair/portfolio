            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, My name is Gajanand Gena. I am a first year undergraduate student of the department of Mining
                Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course at IIT Kharagpur. I am a boarder of Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall
                of Residence. I am a native of Sujangarh, Rajasthan but I live in Mumbai, Maharashtra. My hobbies
                include playing badminton and cricket. Currently I am exploring a few more fields like porgramming,
                mentoring. I am also an Associate Member at Rajasthan Cultural Association IIT Kharagpur (RCA IIT KGP)
                and also an Associate UI/UX Designer at KodeinKGP, IIT Kharagpur.
            </p>

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <h4>KodeinKGP App Design</h4>
                    <p>This project was the design of an app which I created using Figma. I basically did this project
                        for the selection process of KodeinKGP. There were various other tasks available as well such as
                        PPT presentation for AI & Blockchain related topics, Poster designing, etc. But since I was
                        interested in UI/UX designing, I did this task.
                        Later I got a deadline extension mail from them and then I decided to do the web development
                        task as well since I was interested in it but due to time constraints I was unable to do it. But
                        I finished it later.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <h4>Global Entrepreneurship Summit 2023 website design</h4>
                    <p>This project I did for the selection process of Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur. Basically I
                        was assigned a task to create a replics of the GES 2023 website on figma with all animations and
                        share the prototype for further process, and since I was interested in UI/UX designing, I
                        completed this task.

                    <h3>Project 3</h3>
                    <h4>Personal Portfolio Website</h4>
                    <p>Until now I only had idea of HTML and little CSS, so I created a simple, clean website using HTML
                        & CSS only. This is what it is! Probably I will create a new, better website in future after
                        learning everything about web developemt. </p>
